# Sportly

Sportly is an ongoing project aimed at providing football statistics to users. The design of the app is inspired by the Soccer Mobile App concept available at [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/92564557/Soccer-Mobile-App). The app is being developed entirely using code, without relying on Storyboards as the primary interface builder.

- Language: The app is developed using Swift.
- User Interface: The user interface is implemented programmatically using UIKit or SwiftUI.
- Networking: Sportly utilizes APIs to fetch football-related data, such as match results, player statistics, and news updates.
